## Project title
Dog Party by Justin Pyktel

## Motivation
As our first class assignment we were to construct a website from scratch that matches a static comp. Our limitations were that we were not allowed to us CSS Grid or Flexbox.

## Build status
Finished. (Not Perfect)

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML & CSS</b>

## Features
The one feature I have implemented is that the Nav links up top link to the buttons lower on the page. The buttons do not have a function, however it is clickable.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: The biggest being getting the colomns to work properly! With the colomns I could not get the buttons at the bottom to lineup properly, I tried quite a few things (ie. padding/margin, position relative/absolute). Shrinking it down causes issues with the colomns as well and makes them stagger. The nav bar also staggers the links when shrunk down to tablet size or smaller.

Wins: Most of it went rather smooth. Getting the background image setup and the form section. The Footer bar went well. 

## How to use?
While using Dog Party I recommend keeping the size at full size or half(split screen). Otherwise the columns and or Nav at the top will get all wonky.

## Credits
I would like to thank my classmates (ie. Mike, Devin, Rachel, Melissa, and more) for allowing me to bounce ideas off eachother and coming up with awesome solutions.

## Project title
Static-Comp 1 by Justin Pyktel

## Motivation
As our second class assignment we were to construct a website from scratch that matches a static comp. Our limitations were that we were not allowed to us CSS Grid. But we were allowed to use whatever content/theme we wanted, as long as it followed the layout.

## Build status
Finished. (Not Perfect)

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with HTML & CSS</b>

## Features
I took full advantage of flex-box to manipulate the page, so that it is more responsive. Using containers to keep everything nice and grouped helped a lot.

## Challenges/Wins
Many challenges!!: I wish I would have delegated more time to this project, I would have added more fancy features and fixed a few styling issues.

Biggest win: was being able to keep the theme, I even had to mess with photoshop(gimp) to get the icons just right. 

## How to use?
While using Dog Party I recommend keeping the size at full size or half(split screen). Otherwise the columns and or Nav at the top will get all wonky.

## Credits
Big thank you to Flex-Box Froggy!!
